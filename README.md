# Google Trends API #

Your task is to create a small web application that uses the Google
Trends API to retrieve search keyword metrics. You should implement a
simple frontend using modern JavaScript (React, ES6) as well as Python
and a web framework such as Django, Flask or Werkzeug to implement
a simple backend for the application.

Input parameters are the keywords for which the report should be
created. The report should show interest over time for the keywords
entered.

Please note that the API is not officially documented by Google but you
can mimic a user by reversing the requests made by Googleâ€™s web client
(https://trends.google.com/trends/)
